Data preprocessing and analysis about screen time and sleep time. 
This is the code processing and analysis to find correlation between screen time, occupation, and the habit change during pandemic.

### Datasets
#### `dataset/raw.csv` 
is a dataset that have been gathered through google form.

#### `dataset/adjusted.csv` 
is a dataset that have been cleaned. There are data that doesn't meet our requirements, so we need to remove it. 

#### `dataset/encoded.csv` 
is a dataset that have been encoded because the data is basically an ordinal. It's a conversion from the ordinal data into integer data.


###  Analysis
There are two analysis we did in this research, descriptive analysis -- including chi squared correlation test and regresion analysis. 
But afterall, we just use the descriptive cross tabular analysis and chi squared correlation test.
