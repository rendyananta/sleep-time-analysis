# Analytics Correlation between Screen Time, Occupation, and Pandemic Event with Sleep Time Quantity
Data preprocessing and analysis about screen time and sleep time. 
This is the code processing and analysis to find correlation between screen time, occupation, and the habit change during pandemic.

### Datasets
#### `dataset/raw.csv` 
is a dataset that have been gathered through google form.

#### `dataset/adjusted.csv` 
is a dataset that have been cleaned. There are data that doesn't meet our requirements, so we need to remove it. 

#### `dataset/encoded.csv` 
is a dataset that have been encoded because the data is basically an ordinal. It's a conversion from the ordinal data into integer data.


###  Analysis
There are two analysis we did in this research, descriptive analytics -- including chi squared correlation test and regresion analytics. 
But afterall, we just use the descriptive cross tabular analysis and chi squared correlation test.
